<p> One of the most well known animated character is the famous Mickey Mouse. This character was created by a very talented person named Walt Disney. Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901. He is responsible for creating Walt Disney Studios with his cartoon characters, animated and live-action films, etc. Walt Disney created the first cartoons with synchronized sound and the first full-length animated feature film. He moved to Hollywood, California with his brother to find a place in the entertainment industry. Then, Walt Disney and his brother, Roy Disney opened up their own studio called Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio. Disney was striving for a distribution deal, so he refined one of his animation series called Alice Comedies. He did achieve this goal and sold the rights to this series to Margaret Winkler, a distributor, and got paid $1,500 per film. This deal really started his career and he grew to be one of the most victorious entrepreneurs of all time.
